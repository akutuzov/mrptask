=head1 NAME

Node

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Graph> holds a list of nodes and can return the C<Node> based on its
C<ID> (the first column in a CoNLL-U file, can be integer or a decimal number).
Edges are stored in nodes.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item parent

Refers to the parent C<Phrase>, if any.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $phrase->set_parent ($nonterminal_phrase);

Sets a new parent for this phrase. The parent phrase must be a L<nonterminal|Treex::Core::Phrase::NTerm>.
This phrase will become its new I<non-head> child.
The new parent may also be undefined, which means that the current phrase will
be disconnected from the phrase structure (but it will keeep its own children,
if any).
The method returns the old parent.
