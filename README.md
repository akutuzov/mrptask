# TO DO

* Ask organizers for the companion data we want to use:
  * Universal Dependencies English treebanks (EWT, GUM, ParTUT, PUD, LinES) release 2.3
  * Penn Treebank 3 constituent annotation
  * PropBank, NomBank
  * Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (at least the English part, including tectogrammatical trees)
  * FasText word embeddings and/or the large crawled English corpus that was available for the last two CoNLL shared tasks (UD parsing)
  * _Anything else?_
* Collect the initial data on ÃšFAL network: `/net/work/projects/mrptask` (Dan).
* Look for suitable implementations of graph parsers (Kira).
* Look for possibilities of "UD enhancement" (Dan).
